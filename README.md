# Auto-generation of Lo-fi Hip-hop w/ Tonality

This project repository is the result of my multiple attempts to hack together a very basic lo-fi hip hop beat generator. The project consists of an extendable object-oriented hierarchy of musical objects (notes, chords, major seventh chord, etc), a "Composer" class to sequentially decide which chords should be generated, a (cloned) synthesizer piano class to play the notes and a "Processor" class to overlay the .wav samples over our newly synthesized track. 

Check out [sample beats](http:/pl728.github.io/lofi-site) produced by this algo!!
