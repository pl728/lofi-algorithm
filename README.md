# Tonality Based Generation of Lo-fi Hip-hop

This algorithm is the result of my attempts to produce a very basic lo-fi hip hop beat with the click of a button. The project consists of an extendable object-oriented hierarchy of musical objects (notes, chords, major seventh chord, etc), a "Composer" class to sequentially decide which chords should be generated, a (cloned) synthesizer piano class to play the notes and a "Processor" class to overlay the .wav samples over our newly synthesized track. 

Check out [sample beats](www.pl728.github.io/lofi-site) produced by this algo!!
